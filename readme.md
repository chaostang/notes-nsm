Here is the reading assignment of the course *Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics*. Apart from the course textbook by Pottier, I have referred to several other books in preparing these notes:

* Pottier, *Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics: Linear Irreversible Processes*, Oxford University Press 2010.
* Kardar, *Statistical Physics of Particles*, Cambridge University Press 2007.
* Peliti, *Statistical Mechanics in a Nutshell*, Princeton University Press 2011.
* Weinberg, *The Quantum Theory of Fields, Vol.1*, Cambridge University Press 1995.

Regarding the division into formalism and application, I choose to lean towards the former. Therefore, among the many examples and applications in the textbook, I have included only the particularly enlightening (and interesting) ones. On the other hand, in a few places where the discussion in the book is not detailed enough, I have tried to borrow examples from or build toy models inspired by the other books.

I find my (re)organization of materials very helpful in clarifying the ideas for myself. I hope it should also help whoever comes across these notes as well.
